    "> **remember:** reading from a csv file in python looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "    with open(file_name) as f:\n",
    "        # we are using DictReader because we want our information to be in dictionary format.\n",
    "        reader = csv.DictReader(f)\n",
    "        # some more code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our `reader` reading our file as dictionaries, we want our data to be a list of dictionaries. So, we need to loop through our `reader` and create a list. *hint: list comprehension / for loops are your friend\"\n",

    "# our data will look something like this once we have read it and turned it into a list of `OrderedDict`s\n",

We have another file -- a text file! -- that contains the data we need for the top 500 songs.

This is a good practice for ensuring that our code is as reusable and modular as possible, which is important when writing code for any project, especially when it comes time to scale a project.
