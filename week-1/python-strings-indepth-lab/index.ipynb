    "First thing we should talk about is the ways we can format strings. After all, we are programmers and we will usually need to make our strings programmatic. There are two main forms of combining and formatting strings called concatenation and interpolation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Concatenation** is the operation of joining strings end-to-end. When we concatenate two strings, we are basically adding them together. So, if I have one string, `\"Hello, my name is\"`, and a second string, `\"Terrance!\"`, I can concatenate them together and make one longer string.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpolation** is the insertion of string variables into parts of an existing string. When we interpolate, we mark where we would like to insert values into a string (like placeholders), and then pass the values to the string, resulting in a string where the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding string values. In Python it would look something like this: `\"Hi, my name is {}\".format(\"Terrance!\")` which would yield \"Hello, my name is Terrance!\""

    "As we can see there are 4 different was to format strings in python! That can be pretty confusing. So, in general we should choose one method and stick to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we're simply combining a few strings end to end, concatenating them is the way to go (the one with the `+` signs).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we are interpolating we have three options. As with everything in Python and programming, it is important to have a reason behind every decision. A reason to not use the `%s` method would be that it can quickly become confusing if we have more than one element to interpolate since our markers for interpolation are just a non-descript symbol (`%s`). So, if we eliminate the first method of interpolation, we are left with the last two. There are benefits to both. \n",
    "\n",
    "`f-strings` or `string literals` allow you to directly interpolate strings and functions. You can more easily separate the things you want to interpolate so that it is not all bunched together, and maybe more significantly f-strings are much faster than other forms of string interpolation. However, the f-string is new to python as of version 3.6. So, they may not be supported on all applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "the `.format` method is also a good way of interpolating with strings. We simply choose where you would like to have a value interpolated and mark it with the double curly braces `{}`. Optionally, we can define a variable name inside the curly braces, `{name}`. Then, we give the `.format` method the arguments necessary. If we do not define a variable name (i.e. \"hello my name is {}\".format(\"Terrance\")), then we just give the value we want to be interpolated. If we do decide to define a variable, (i.e. \"hello my name is {name}\".format(name=\"Terrance\")), then we will need to tell our `.format` method what value to assign to each variable."
